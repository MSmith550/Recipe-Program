Simple recipe book program

This is a simple recipe book program that I am writeing in Java8 using javafx.

The design of the program has been completed and all but one of the buttons work as intended. the only thing that is left is to write the code for the file reader/writer. I am thinking of useing a Json file formation as I have a Json parser to reading that format.
